# Final project

Air conditioning and temperature control using the ESP32 microcontroller.

thie heart of ther device is the ESP32 that communicate and read values from the LM75 temperature sensor using the I2C protocol.

This temperature vlue will be display on a ILI9341 LCD DISPLAY and RGB LED.

this device will be controlled by interface using the MQTT protocol with any device with connection privileges to the MQTT CLOUD
